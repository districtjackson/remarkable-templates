# remarkable-templates

Free Remarklable Templates, based around James Clear's ideas on habits from his Atomic Habits book and miscellaneous Dungeons & Dragons character sheets.

Big thanks to [Jakob Klemm](https://github.com/jakobklemm) for creating the Habit Tracking template.

If you need help uploading them to your reMarkable, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl1krpUZTdo) video is a great tutorial on how to do so.
